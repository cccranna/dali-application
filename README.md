My project focuses on Washington State and the publicly available disaster relief data provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) to further public awareness surrounding weather disasters. My original goal was to focus on the API docs that FEMA has used historically that outline disaster relief locations, particularly in the state of Washington due to their coastal vulnerabilities. I wanted to create an interactive map that would allow users to be alerted if/when a disaster occurred and where these relief locations could be found. However, I ran into a number of roadblocks collecting data from both FEMA and other disaster relief center organizations as their APIs were no longer updated or not publicly available. This led me to utilize the data that was available to me, and I decided to use FEMA’s database that outlined Hazard Mitigation Assistance Projects. This API collects information on various relief projects throughout all fifty states, but I was able to filter to the state of Washington, then later to the individual counties I chose to focus on for the scale of this project. The second API I chose to incorporate is the weather data provided by the US government. I incorporated this as an alert tab that when my interactive regions were clicked (Spokane, Seattle, Yakima, and Olympia) any current weather alerts would be easily seen. 

I have always been interested in tracking public health issues, particularly within the environment, and I was further inspired by hearing about a few Dartmouth seniors in the EARS department on their senior thesis’ about natural disaster impacts. I knew starting with larger regions such as Washington state would yield more data to build a baseline with, but I know more rural areas, such as areas in the Upper Valley, would benefit greatly from more research and awareness projects on environmental impacts. While I know my specific project has its limitations, I would love to work on projects like this that could focus on underrepresented regions and raise awareness about disaster mitigation.

Throughout my time on the WISP team, I became really familiar with design UI/UX tools such as Figma as that was our focus for the first half of our time together. During the spring I was introduced in a more hands on way with the development side, particularly with APIs. I really enjoyed getting to know more about APIs through WISP and seeing the local impact using Dartmouth specific APIs in our project, and I also loved getting to use brand new APIs in this project such as one that used GeoJson feature data rather than the data structures I was more familiar with. Additionally through this project I learned with the help of Stack Overflow how to create an interactive IMG by creating an SVG. By making a React App, I was able to implement some of the development tools I learned through WISP while also learning a few new ones through some online research, which I enjoyed getting the opportunity to explore. 

When I first started thinking about this project a few weeks ago, I had hoped to include other APIs such as News API to incorporate user searches. The goal was that for any hazard mitigation project that would pop up the user could then search for any relevant news articles. However, I found that the API from News API was extremely particularly about key words and phrases for filtering. With more experience using filtering logic, I would have loved to have been able to pick out keywords from the project titles so that a news API such as this one could have made the project more user interactive. With that being said, I would say the biggest challenge I faced during this project was having to step away from the application for so long. Due to my medical leave, finishing my final exams, and then doctors appointments following the end of term I only had a few days to complete this application to get it in as soon as possible. I think this project shows a lot of what I have learned through DALI already, but I hope that it also shows just how much more I want to learn from the lab to continue working on my development skills for more in depth and advanced projects in the future.
